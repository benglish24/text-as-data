# 3-2 Parsing Texts

Let me repeat a simple truth: words are finite; sentences are infinite. The longer a text, the more possible alternate texts exist for its given length. Given what we know about the effect of vocabulary on meaning, a bounded vocabulary would limit the meanings of those texts, but it would not limit the number of ways the meaning could be expressed. (Within reason: grammars do affect word combinations, and so do affect possible sentences, given a bounded vocabulary.)
