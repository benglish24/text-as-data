      " Thank you. I‚Äôm just a very lonely person. I had someone, kind of, or at least I thought I did (maybe I never had her; I don‚Äôt know), but she doesn‚Äôt want me anymore. I‚Äôve been trying to find someone for a long time now. I‚Äôm the real deal. I like sex, but I find non-procreative sex pointless. My theory is that men were given the urge so that they‚Äôd procreate. So I understand we have that urge and need to satiate it, lest we go mad, but I find it totally pointless if it‚Äôs not for making babies. I‚Äôm not big on banging anything that moves. I used to go to pubs and clubs and did some of that, but never as much as I could‚Äôve if I‚Äôd really wanted to. Those encounters are short-lived and leave you feeling very alone and used the next day when she‚Äôs left in a cab. I‚Äôm not about that and never was. I did it, but only because I couldn‚Äôt find a woman to marry me and give me kids. Now, every girl I meet who says she wants that is more interested in her work/business or too broken to pair bond anymore/scared of getting hurt again. It seems many girls have picked the wrong men, been hurt and damaged, and now good men are suffering because, well, hurt people hurt people. I‚Äôve wanted to marry since I was a teenager, but it just never happened for me because ‚Äî women lol. One could argue I was never a good enough man? I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm trying to be the best man I can be. I‚Äôm trying to improve. I want to be a good man. I want to be worthy of a good girl, if there is such a thing anymore\n",
      " \n",
      " Maybe we‚Äôll just die out and the jews will win. Maybe we deserve this. Our men let our women down and now they‚Äôre letting us down by refusing to breed. Our generation will suffer because of what the Boomers did. The Boomers are the worse generation that ever lived. They‚Äôve totally destroyed everything for us. They had careers, safe neighbourhoods, money, children. We weren‚Äôt afforded any of those things because of their mistakes, and we‚Äôll die out having never created life. It‚Äôs crazy to think that a whole generation will never be. The generation born of the Millennials will be so incidental that it‚Äôll be as if they were never there. The children of Gen Xers might be a bit more fruitful, but I‚Äôm not sure. I think we‚Äôre doomed\n",
